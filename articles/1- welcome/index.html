        <section class="content"><p>I once started a blog and, like many others bloggers, ended up abandoning it. Why is this time going to be any different? Because reasons are different. Now I do it for pleasure. I received so much from the IT community during the last years that I want to start sharing things back. Maybe I can help someone around the world.

</p>
<p>Something that I find interesting is that I have more things to share from my last 2 years as a freelancer than from my 10 years of working as a full time Software Engineer in local companies. I will share my experience in future posts for those who are interested in becoming a freelancer, but feel free to contact me if you cannot wait!

</p>
<p>Build stuff and enjoy life!</p>
