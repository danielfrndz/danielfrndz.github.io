        <section class="content"><p>As many people out there, I constantly deal with the <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.williamting.com/posts/2012/10/30/why-we-bookmark/">three categories of bookmarking</a>: Now, Later, and Future. For those who never read about those categories, let me explain them quickly. &quot;Now&quot; is for URLs that you are using right <b>now</b> such as research URLs about your current project, Gmail, etc. (yes, all those tabs that you have open!); &quot;Later&quot; category represents what you find interesting to take a deeper look <b>later</b> when you have more time available and &quot;Future&quot; are the bookmarks you want to archive/organize to access someday in the long <b>future</b>.

</p>
<p>The problem is that I have to use different apps for each category. That makes it really difficult to smoothly move a bookmark from one category to another. I wish there was a solution that properly handles all three of them.

</p>
<p>But there is none (at least not a popular one). 

</p>
<p>Why is that? 

</p>
<p>We get at least two to three new bookmarking sites each month. 

</p>
<p>Why most do not work?

</p>
<p>Why lots of people are still looking for a way to save their bookmarks?

</p>
<p>What they want is all over the Web, just so a quick search and can find lots of comment and feedback on what not-yet-satisfied users want:

</p>
<p>&quot;I mainly want this so that I can organize them (delete, properly name, putting them into different folders, etc) and download them as html.&quot;
&quot;Apart from cross device availability, please make collaboration easier. Many times I bookmark pages for later market research or sharing it with my coworkers&quot;
&quot;... really simple and good search, RSS for tags, syncing with my bookmarks on all the browsers&quot;
&quot;... letting me save my bookmarks to a bookmark file readable by Firefox&quot;
&quot;They have to shown thats it&apos;s really really easy before they become converts. &quot;
&quot;I can&apos;t be bothered with tagging or confirmation dialogs. I just want to press a single button and have the browser remember it.&quot;
&quot;I wish there was a program that let you import HTML/JSON files into it from FF, IE, Chrome, Safari, etc then had some good organization features almost exactly like firefox. It should also have the ability to delete duplicate links, organize links, put tags, create folders, etc.&quot;
&quot;I really want a private bookmarking thing that will: i) Import all my bookmarks.  ii) Gradually crawl images for all those bookmarks. iii) Display everything in a pinterest style grid iv) allow me to drag and drop links around; to add dividers; etc v) allow me to add tags or descriptions etc.  &quot; 

</p>
<p>Something is clear, there is a portion of the market that wants something else when it comes to bookmarking. 
But it has to be disruptive. Bookmarking prove to be much more complex that what most people think. 

</p>
<p>I find it interesting that almost big innovation on bookmarking has been done in the last years.

<p>I read about Bitcoin back in 2011, but it was not until this year that I got really involved with it. For those who never heard about Bitcoin, it is just a new currency, like dollars or euros. Some people describe it as a &apos;digital currency&apos; or &apos;crypto-currency&apos;, but I prefer to use only the term &apos;currency&apos; to ease its adoption as suggested in this excellent <a target="_blank" href="http://thegenesisblock.com/five-easy-ways-you-can-make-bitcoin-a-mainstream-currency/">article</a> by Jonathan Stacke. 

</p>
<p>Without going into much details on how it works (I look forward to explain it in future posts), let just say that it operates thanks to the collective power of many connected computers. If you want more details right away, visit <a target="_blank" href="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin&apos;s official site</a> or check this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo">video</a>.

</p>
<p>The great thing about Bitcoin is that it is not regulated by any central authority. You can transfer money directly to another person with your computer or mobile. Wow! A non-regulated currency! ... wait, wonÂ´t that scare people? No. At least not here in Argentina where we know about regulations. Our goverment regulates the amount of dollars you can buy (regulates, not prohibit), so Bitcoin raises as an insteresting alternative currency.

</p>
<p>One week ago, <a target="_blank" href="http://bitcoinfilm.org/">Bitcoinfilm.org</a> created a documentary about Bitcoins in Argentina. 

</p>
<p>Here it is:

</p>
<p>This video made its way to a major <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1575169-bitcoin-como-una-alternativa-a-las-restricciones-cambiarias-en-la-argentina#v_video_">Argentinian newspaper (spanish)</a> and I noticed that many friends starting talking about it, asking questions mostly. They were certainly interested in Bitcoin. Besides that, around 100 people assist to last <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Buenos-Aires/events/110480272/">Bitcoin MeetUp in Buenos Aires</a> and it is not crazy to expect that more people will assist to future ones. 

</p>
<p>Those are all positive signs. You can tell that Argentina is slowly adopting it. There is still a long path down the road for Bitcoins, but it worth following it.

</p>
<p>Spread the word!
