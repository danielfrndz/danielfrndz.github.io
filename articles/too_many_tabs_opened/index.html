<h3>Have you ever had so many tabs opened that favicons start dissapearing?</h3>

<h3>Or wait eternal minutes to recover from a browser crash?</h3>

<h3>And then try to find from what tab the sound is coming from?</h3>
</p>

<p>If you experienced one of those things, welcome to the <b>&quot;too many tabs&quot;</b> club. Do not worry, some members have <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6147583" target="_blank">over 300 tabs opened</a>. Outsiders cannot understand how we can manage all those tabs at the same time, they think there is a serious problem with us.

</p>
<p>The truth? We are not managing all those tabs, we are just <b>piling them up</b>.

</p>
<p>It is clear that tabs <b>perform an important role</b> in the way we navigate today. I got so used to them that is hard to remember those days when browsers did not implemented tab functionality. I tend to <b>abuse the &quot;Open in New Tab&quot;</b> option.

</p>
<p>However, when I take a detailed look at my browser tabs, I find that most of them are things that I am <b>not using right now</b> and I do <b>not even want to bookmark them for the future</b> (takes time and they get mixed with my bookmarks). I just want to <b>check them later</b>. That means that I may need them later to work, to share with my friends or to read during my free time. 

</p>
<p>Of course there are tabs that I like to have constantly opened like Gmail, but from my current <b>98</b> opened tabs, I only need <b>5</b> right now. <b>That is only a 5%!</b> 

</p>
<p>If I had a way to freeze the tabs I do not use, I could <b>free some memory</b>.

</p>
<p>That is why my partner and I are building <a href="http://listboard.it/" target="_blank">Listboard.it</a>.

</p>
<p><img src="/images/articles/listboard_it_capture.png" alt="Listboard.it capture"/> 

</p>
<p>With <a href="http://listboard.it/" target="_blank">Listboard.it</a>, you keep <b>your browser(s) in sync on real time</b> and easily <b>drag windows or tabs to a later listboard</b>. After dragging a tab, it will automatically close. Then you can recover those windows/tabs whenever you want.

</p>
<p>Are you worried about losing the tab context? Trust me, <b>you can always get the context back</b>. It does not justify keeping the tab opened.

</p>
<p>You <b>can also bookmark tabs</b> by just dragging them to a future listboard and organize them using hierarchical lists. Also, <a href="http://listboard.it/" target="_blank">Listboard.it</a> understands that <b>the 3 steps of bookmarking do not always happen at the same time</b>:
</p>
<p><ul class="numbered">
    <li>Open an URL</li>
    <li>Analyze the content</li>
    <li>Save it</li>
</ul>
Step 2 can happen a day after step 1.

</p>
<p>So if are part of the club, want to free some memory and agree that <b>bookmarking is not the solution</b>, feel free to <a href="http://listboard.it/" target="_blank">register for early testing</a> or share <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6258433" target="_blank">your comment on HN</a>. 

</p>
<p>I would love to hear your opinion.
