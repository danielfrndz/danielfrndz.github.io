        <section class="content"><p>I once started a blog and, like many others bloggers, ended up abandoning it. Why is this time going to be any different? Because reasons are different. 

</p>
<p>I do not want to use it to promote myself and find a good job, but because I received so much from the IT community during the last years that I want to start sharing things back. Maybe I can help someone around the world. 

</p>
<p>As a personal plus, I will improve my post writting skills. Circumstantially, I also feel that I have more things to share now than back then when I was already graduated as a Software Engineer and had over 10 years of experience in developing. 

</p>
<p>I will write a post on this, explaining why I feel that I learned more over my freelancer years when I choosed what to read, than when I was studying Software engenieering in college and working for argentinian sotware companies.

</p>
<p>So, I will end up this first introductory post by sharing my goals for 2013. Writing them here is a way to formalize them. 

</p>
<p>Here they are:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve my skills with Sublime Text 2 to develop</li>
<li>Correct the position of some typing fingers and reach 50 WPM</li>
<li>Reach a week excersice routine and lose 6 kilograms</li>
<li>Launch Tagnfile.it and reach the first 500 users</li>
<li>Fully migrate to Ubuntu (I still use some windows programs)</li>
<li>Learn at least one unrelated activity like salsa or sailing</li>
<li>Launch danielf.com.ar blog and write at least 30 posts</li>
<li>Create at least 3 opensources proyects to share in Github</li>
<li>Read at leasst 4 books</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, my goals are not that hard to accomplish (except for the 500 users one), but that is ok. It is the first time I do this and I want to enjoy the path and check results by 2014. What is interesting is that some goals are measurable: 50 WPm, 6 kilograms, 500 users, 30 posts, 3 opensource proyects, 4 books. I did this on purpose to have some values to compare at the end of the year. I suggest you do the same and write the goals you want to achieve this year. Do not push your limits, just do it for fun.
