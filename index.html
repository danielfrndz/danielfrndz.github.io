        <section class="content"><p>At the beggining of the year, I set some goals that I want to share with you as a way to formalize them:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve my skills with Sublime Text 2</li>
<li>Correct the position of my fingers when typing and reach 50 WPM</li>
<li>Have weekly excersice routine and lose 6 kilograms</li>
<li>Launch <a href="http://tagnfile.it">Tagnfile.it</a> and reach the first 500 users</li>
<li>Learn at least one unrelated activity like salsa dance or sailing</li>
<li>Launch new personal blog and write at least 30 posts</li>
<li>Create/Colaborate in 3 or more opensources proyects</li>
<li>Read at least 4 books</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, my goals are not that hard to accomplish (well, maybe the 500 users one). The important detail about most of them is that they are measurable: 50 WPm, 6 kilograms, 500 users, 1 activity, 30 posts, 3 opensource proyects, 4 books. I did this on purpose to have some values to compare at the end of the year and then laugh at myself thinking &quot;What in the hell was I thinking?&quot;. 

</p>
<p>Seriously, I suggest you do the same and write the goals you want to achieve this year. Do not push your limits, just do it for fun.

        <section class="content"><p>I once started a blog and, like many others bloggers, ended up abandoning it. Why is this time going to be any different? Because reasons are different. Now I do it for pleasure. I received so much from the IT community during the last years that I want to start sharing things back. Maybe I can help someone around the world.

</p>
<p>Something that I find interesting is that I have more things to share from my last 2 years as a freelancer than from my 10 years of working as a full time Software Engineer in local companies. I will share my experience in future posts for those who are interested in becoming a freelancer, but feel free to contact me if you cannot wait!

</p>
<p>Build stuff and enjoy life!</p>
